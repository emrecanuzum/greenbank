# GreenBank Front-End Test Job (Designed by Emrecan Üzüm)

This project is a pre-employment test for front-end.

## Connect Wallet

I used Solana Wallet Adaptor for this project. As you can see below, when user clicks the "Select Wallet", system shows a pop-up that contains detected wallets including phantom, backpack etc..

After that, user can see the publicAddress of selected wallet at the area of Selected Wallet. Also user can disconnect the wallet and select another wallet too.

## Dynamic Data

The data fetching with server side props is like below, I put a placeholder values to About.tsx component that if there is an error with api calls.

After fetching data, we need to use it in our component function.

Finally, this is how API data is rendered for user:
